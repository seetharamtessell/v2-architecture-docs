# V2 Architecture Documentation

## Purpose

This repository maintains the **complete architecture documentation** for the AWS CloudOps AI Agent system (V2). It serves as the **single source of truth** for architectural decisions, component designs, and related repositories across the entire project ecosystem.

## Scope

This is a **10,000-foot view** documentation project that covers:

- High-level system architecture
- Component interactions and data flows
- Technology stack decisions and rationale
- Security and privacy architecture
- Performance considerations
- Integration patterns
- Repository organization and references

## Key Architecture Principles

1. **Client-side AWS Estate Management**: All AWS resource data and credentials remain local
2. **Server-side Operations Knowledge**: Stateless server provides playbook execution logic
3. **Privacy First**: No AWS credentials or estate data sent to server
4. **Semantic Search**: Local Qdrant vector DB enables fast, fuzzy resource lookup
5. **Precision Over Guessing**: Client sends complete context; server generates exact scripts

## Project Status

### Client Modules

| Module | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **[Storage Service](docs/02-client/modules/storage-service/)** | âœ… Design Complete | Estate + Chat storage with RAG, IAM integration, Auto S3 backup |
| **[Execution Engine](docs/02-client/modules/execution-engine/)** | ðŸ”„ To be designed | AWS command execution, Approval workflow |
| **[Estate Scanner](docs/02-client/modules/estate-scanner/)** | ðŸ”„ To be designed | AWS resource discovery, Multi-account scanning |
| **[Request Builder](docs/02-client/modules/request-builder/)** | ðŸ”„ To be designed | Context enrichment, Server communication |

### Storage Service Highlights

The Storage Service is fully designed and ready for implementation:

- **Single Qdrant Instance** - Embedded mode (~20-30 MB) for both chat and AWS estate
- **Dual Collection Strategy** - Chat history (1D dummy vectors) + AWS Estate (384D real embeddings)
- **IAM Integration** - Permissions embedded per resource (allowed/denied actions + user context)
- **Application-Level Encryption** - AES-256-GCM with OS Keychain integration
- **Point ID Management** - Random UUIDs for chat, deterministic IDs for estate (prevents duplicates)
- **Auto S3 Backup** - Background scheduler with configurable retention (7d local, 30d S3)

See [Storage Service Documentation](docs/02-client/modules/storage-service/) for complete API reference and implementation guide.

## Guidelines for Contributors

- Maintain architectural purity: document **what** and **why**, not implementation details
- Keep diagrams and flows updated with any architectural changes
- Reference related repositories but avoid duplicating implementation docs
- Focus on system-level decisions, not code-level specifics
