# Escher - Multi-Cloud Operations Management Platform
## Product Vision & Architecture Goals

**Last Updated**: October 2025
**Status**: Active Discussion - Defining Complete Scope

---

## **üîê Critical Architecture Principle**

**‚ö†Ô∏è ESCHER AI SERVER IS 100% STATELESS - REGARDLESS OF DEPLOYMENT MODEL**

Whether user chooses **Local Only** or **Extend My Laptop** deployment:
- **Escher AI Server stores NOTHING**: No user data, no cloud estate, no credentials, no chat history, no state
- **Escher AI Server is a pure processing engine**: Receives requests ‚Üí Processes with RAG ‚Üí Returns responses ‚Üí Forgets everything
- **All state resides with the user**: On physical laptop (Local Only) or in user's cloud (Extend My Laptop)
- **Privacy guarantee**: User's cloud estate and credentials NEVER leave user's control

---

## Product Overview

**Escher** is a Multi-Cloud Operations AI Platform that enables users to manage cloud operations across **AWS, Azure, and GCP** through a unified conversational interface.

### Core Philosophy
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Single platform for AWS, Azure, GCP (and future cloud providers)
- **Conversational Management**: Natural language interface for all cloud operations
- **Unified Experience**: Consistent interface across all cloud providers
- **User-Controlled State**: State and execution remain in user's control (local or user's cloud)
- **Privacy First**: Escher AI Server is 100% stateless - stores nothing about users
- **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Server provides cloud-agnostic operations knowledge, recommendations, and playbook generation
- **Flexible Deployment**: User chooses local-only or extended to cloud model

---

## Deployment Architecture

Escher offers **two deployment models** to meet different user needs:

### **Model 1: Local Only** (Beta / Lightweight Users)

**Target Users**: Individual contributors, small teams, users with simple operations

**Architecture**:
- **Physical Laptop** runs Tauri application (Rust backend + React frontend)
- **Local Execution**: All operations execute from laptop using Rust execution engine
- **Local State**: Chat history, estate inventory, credentials stored on laptop
- **Requirements**: Laptop must stay online for scheduled operations

**Pros**:
- Zero cloud infrastructure costs
- Complete local control
- Simple setup

**Cons**:
- Laptop must remain online for scheduled jobs
- Limited to laptop's compute resources
- No cross-device access to state

---

### **Model 2: Extend My Laptop** (Main Release / Power Users)

**Target Users**: Teams with scheduled operations, long-running tasks, 24/7 requirements

**Architecture**:
```
Physical Laptop (Tauri App) ‚Üê‚Üí Escher AI Server (Stateless Brain)
        ‚Üì‚Üë                              ‚Üë
Extend My Laptop (User's Cloud)          |
        ‚Üì                                |
Cloud Schedulers + Execution + State ‚Üê--‚îò
```

**Components in User's Cloud**:

| Cloud Provider | Scheduler | Execution | State Storage | Credentials |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AWS** | EventBridge | Fargate | S3 | SSM Parameter Store |
| **Azure** | Logic Apps / Functions | Container Instances | Blob Storage | Key Vault |
| **GCP** | Cloud Scheduler | Cloud Run | Cloud Storage | Secret Manager |

**Setup Process**:
1. User chooses "Extend to Cloud" from physical laptop
2. User selects cloud provider for Extend My Laptop (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
3. Physical laptop uses **user's local credentials** to provision infrastructure in **user's account**:
   - Deploys **Escher-provided container image** (Rust execution engine + cloud CLIs)
   - Creates scheduler (EventBridge/Logic Apps/Cloud Scheduler)
   - Creates state storage (S3/Blob/GCS buckets)
   - Creates credential storage (SSM/Key Vault/Secret Manager)
4. User **installs cloud credentials** in Extend My Laptop (just like local laptop - AWS CLI configure, Azure CLI login, gcloud auth)
5. Physical laptop becomes thin client, Extend My Laptop is single source of truth

**Execution Model**:
- **Physical Laptop**: Interactive operations, ad-hoc queries, real-time tasks
- **Extend My Laptop**: Scheduled operations, long-running tasks, automation, reports
- **Event-Based Lifecycle**: Extend My Laptop starts on-demand, stops when idle (cost optimization)
  - Scheduler triggers wake up Extend My Laptop for scheduled jobs
  - Long-running operations keep Extend My Laptop alive until completion
  - Auto-stops after idle period

**Data Flows**:
1. **User Query**: Physical Laptop ‚Üí Escher AI Server ‚Üí AI response ‚Üí Physical Laptop
2. **Interactive Execution**: Physical Laptop ‚Üí Extend My Laptop ‚Üí Cloud APIs ‚Üí Results ‚Üí State Storage (S3/Blob/GCS)
3. **Scheduled Execution**: Scheduler (EventBridge/etc) ‚Üí Extend My Laptop ‚Üí Cloud APIs ‚Üí Results ‚Üí State Storage
4. **State Sync**: Physical Laptop pulls latest state from Extend My Laptop storage

**Multi-Cloud Management**:
- Extend My Laptop (e.g., on AWS) manages **all clouds** (AWS + Azure + GCP)
- User installs credentials for all clouds in Extend My Laptop's credential store
- Example: AWS Fargate Extend My Laptop with AWS credentials (SSM) + Azure Service Principal (SSM) + GCP Service Account (SSM)

**Escher AI Server Role**:
- **100% Stateless**: Stores nothing about users, no credentials, no state
- **Provides**: LLM responses, operation suggestions, playbook generation, AI intelligence
- **Communication**: Physical Laptop ‚Üî AI Server (for conversational AI), Extend My Laptop ‚Üî AI Server (for scheduled job intelligence)

**Pros**:
- 24/7 operations without laptop online
- Scheduled jobs run reliably
- Long-running operations don't block laptop
- Cross-device access to state
- Event-based compute = lower costs than always-on

**Cons**:
- Cloud infrastructure costs (EventBridge, Fargate/Container Instances, S3/Blob/GCS)
- More complex setup
- Cold start delays for event-based execution

---

### **User Choice**

Users can switch between models:
- Start with **Local Only** for simplicity
- Upgrade to **Extend My Laptop** when they need scheduling/automation
- Downgrade back to **Local Only** anytime (Extend My Laptop infrastructure can be destroyed)

- **Playbook Library**: Comprehensive library of cloud operation playbooks (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **CLI Command Database**: Complete reference of cloud CLI commands and their usage
- **Best Practices**: Cloud architecture patterns, security guidelines, cost optimization strategies
- **Multi-Cloud Operations**: Cross-cloud equivalents and migration patterns

**AI Processing:**
- Natural language understanding (user intent extraction)
- Context-aware response generation
- Operation planning and sequencing
- Playbook generation and customization
- Anomaly detection and recommendations

### **Data Flow Details**

#### **1. Interactive Query Flow (Physical/Extend My Laptop ‚Üí AI Server)**

```

Physical/Extend My Laptop (Client-Side Processing):
‚îú‚îÄ Search local RAG (vector store):
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Cloud Estate Inventory: Check for EC2 instances in us-east-1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Chat History: Retrieve previous conversation context
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Executed Operations: Check recent EC2-related operations
‚îî‚îÄ Prepare context from RAG results

Physical/Extend My Laptop ‚Üí Escher AI Server:
‚îú‚îÄ Query: "Show me all running EC2 instances in us-east-1"
‚îî‚îÄ Context from RAG:
    ‚îú‚îÄ Previous chat history (last 5 messages for continuity)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Relevant estate info (EC2 instance count, regions)
    ‚îî‚îÄ Recent operations (any EC2 operations in last hour)

Escher AI Server Processing:
‚îú‚îÄ Parse intent: List resources
‚îú‚îÄ Identify scope: EC2, us-east-1, running state
‚îú‚îÄ RAG lookup: EC2 list commands/APIs
‚îú‚îÄ Analyze context: Understand user's recent activities
‚îî‚îÄ Generate response type: Information query (not execution)

Escher AI Server ‚Üí Physical/Extend My Laptop:
‚îú‚îÄ Response Type: "information" | "execution" | "report"
‚îú‚îÄ Operation: { type: "list_ec2", filters: { region: "us-east-1", state: "running" } }

2. ‚úÖ Defined scheduled operations execution (local scheduler vs cloud scheduler)
3. ‚úÖ Clarified privacy model (Escher AI Server 100% stateless, state in user's control)
4. ‚úÖ Defined Extend My Laptop provisioning (Escher provisions in user's account with user's credentials)

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Define Data Architecture (COMPLETE)
1. ‚úÖ Historical data retention strategy (vector store with immutable reports collection)
2. ‚úÖ Reports generation and storage model (on-demand + scheduled, stored in vector store)
3. ‚úÖ Cost data collection and aggregation approach (daily snapshots to vector store)
4. ‚úÖ Export formats (PDF, CSV, Excel, JSON via AI generation)
5. ‚úÖ Daily sync for Manager persona (cost + audit logs at 2am)

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Define Personas & RBAC (PENDING)
1. Complete persona definitions (Manager, Executor, others?)
2. Permission model per persona
3. Approval workflows (local vs cloud-based)
4. "Extend me" pattern implementation details
5. Team collaboration mechanisms

### ‚è≥ Phase 4: Document Complete Operations (PENDING)
1. List all supported cloud operations by category
2. Define which operations need approval
3. Risk levels per operation type
4. Automation boundaries
5. Multi-account/subscription/project patterns

## Alignment Check

### ‚úÖ **Fully Aligned & Documented**
- Multi-cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP) with conversational interface
- Two deployment models (Local Only and Extend My Laptop) based on user needs
- State and execution in user's control (local or user's cloud)
- Escher AI Server 100% stateless (no user data, credentials, or state)
- Extend My Laptop provisioned in user's account with user's credentials
- Scheduled operations via cloud schedulers (EventBridge/Logic Apps/Cloud Scheduler)
- Multi-cloud management from single Extend My Laptop
- Rust execution engine for operations (playbooks, CLI commands, shell scripts)
- **Immutable reports in vector store** (cost, audit logs, compliance)
- **Daily sync for Manager persona** (cost + audit logs at 2am)
- **Client-side RAG** with 4 collections (estate, chat, operations, immutable reports)
- **Server-side RAG** with playbook library and cloud operations knowledge
- **V2 release plan** for optional central immutable reports

### üü° **Partially Defined - Need Details**
- Multi-account/subscription/project credential management
- Collaboration and approval workflows
- "Extend me" pattern implementation

### ‚ùå **Not Yet Documented**
- Complete list of supported cloud operations by category
- Personas & RBAC model details
- Budget management features
- Notification and alerting mechanisms (email delivery, Slack, PagerDuty)
