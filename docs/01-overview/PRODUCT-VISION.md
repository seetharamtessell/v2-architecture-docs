# Escher - Multi-Cloud Operations Management Platform
## Product Vision & Architecture Goals

**Last Updated**: October 2025
**Status**: Active Discussion - Defining Complete Scope

---

## **üîê Critical Architecture Principle**

**‚ö†Ô∏è ESCHER AI SERVER IS 100% STATELESS - REGARDLESS OF DEPLOYMENT MODEL**

Whether user chooses **Local Only** or **Extend My Laptop** deployment:
- **Escher AI Server stores NOTHING**: No user data, no cloud estate, no credentials, no chat history, no state
- **Escher AI Server is a pure processing engine**: Receives requests ‚Üí Processes with RAG ‚Üí Returns responses ‚Üí Forgets everything
- **All state resides with the user**: On physical laptop (Local Only) or in user's cloud (Extend My Laptop)
- **Privacy guarantee**: User's cloud estate and credentials NEVER leave user's control

---

## Product Overview

**Escher** is a Multi-Cloud Operations AI Platform that enables users to manage cloud operations across **AWS, Azure, and GCP** through a unified conversational interface.

### Core Philosophy
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Single platform for AWS, Azure, GCP (and future cloud providers)
- **Conversational Management**: Natural language interface for all cloud operations
- **Unified Experience**: Consistent interface across all cloud providers
- **User-Controlled State**: State and execution remain in user's control (local or user's cloud)
- **Privacy First**: Escher AI Server is 100% stateless - stores nothing about users
- **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Server provides cloud-agnostic operations knowledge, recommendations, and playbook generation
- **Flexible Deployment**: User chooses local-only or extended to cloud model

---

## Deployment Architecture

Escher offers **two deployment models** to meet different user needs:

### **Model 1: Local Only** (Beta / Lightweight Users)

**Target Users**: Individual contributors, small teams, users with simple operations

**Architecture**:
- **Physical Laptop** runs Tauri application (Rust backend + React frontend)
- **Local Execution**: All operations execute from laptop using Rust execution engine
- **Local State**: Chat history, estate inventory, credentials stored on laptop
- **Periodic Backup**: Local database snapshot synced to S3/Blob/GCS periodically (configurable interval, default: hourly)
- **Requirements**: Laptop must stay online for scheduled operations

**Pros**:
- Zero cloud compute infrastructure costs (only storage for backups)
- Complete local control
- Simple setup
- Automatic backup to cloud for disaster recovery

**Cons**:
- Laptop must remain online for scheduled jobs
- **Laptop must remain always-on for real-time alerts** (critical limitation for monitoring)
- Limited to laptop's compute resources
- No cross-device access to state (backups for recovery only, not real-time sync)

---

### **Model 2: Extend My Laptop** (Main Release / Power Users)

**Target Users**: Teams with scheduled operations, long-running tasks, 24/7 requirements

**Architecture**:
```
Physical Laptop (Tauri App) ‚Üê‚Üí Escher AI Server (Stateless Brain)
        ‚Üì‚Üë                              ‚Üë
Extend My Laptop (User's Cloud)          |
        ‚Üì                                |
Cloud Schedulers + Execution + State ‚Üê--‚îò
```

**Components in User's Cloud**:

| Cloud Provider | Scheduler | Execution | State Storage | Credentials |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AWS** | EventBridge | Fargate | S3 | SSM Parameter Store |
| **Azure** | Logic Apps / Functions | Container Instances | Blob Storage | Key Vault |
| **GCP** | Cloud Scheduler | Cloud Run | Cloud Storage | Secret Manager |

**Setup Process**:
1. User chooses "Extend to Cloud" from physical laptop
2. User selects cloud provider for Extend My Laptop (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
3. Physical laptop uses **user's local credentials** to provision infrastructure in **user's account**:
   - Deploys **Escher-provided container image** (Rust execution engine + cloud CLIs)
   - Creates scheduler (EventBridge/Logic Apps/Cloud Scheduler)
   - Creates state storage (S3/Blob/GCS buckets)
   - Creates credential storage (SSM/Key Vault/Secret Manager)
4. User **installs cloud credentials** in Extend My Laptop (just like local laptop - AWS CLI configure, Azure CLI login, gcloud auth)
5. Physical laptop becomes thin client, Extend My Laptop is single source of truth

**Execution Model**:
- **Physical Laptop**: Interactive operations, ad-hoc queries, real-time tasks
- **Extend My Laptop**: Scheduled operations, long-running tasks, automation, reports
- **Event-Based Lifecycle**: Extend My Laptop starts on-demand, stops when idle (cost optimization)
  - Scheduler triggers wake up Extend My Laptop for scheduled jobs
  - Long-running operations keep Extend My Laptop alive until completion
  - Auto-stops after idle period

**Data Flows**:

1. **Interactive Query Flow** (Local Only):
   ```
   User Query ‚Üí Physical Laptop searches RAG ‚Üí Sends query + context to AI Server
   ‚Üí AI Server processes ‚Üí Returns response (information/execution/report)
   ‚Üí Physical Laptop executes locally ‚Üí Stores results in local RAG
   ‚Üí Periodic backup to S3/Blob/GCS (hourly)
   ```

2. **Interactive Query Flow** (Extend My Laptop):
   ```
   User Query ‚Üí Physical Laptop searches local RAG ‚Üí Sends query + context to AI Server
   ‚Üí AI Server processes ‚Üí Returns response
   ‚Üí Physical Laptop sends execution request to Extend My Laptop
   ‚Üí Extend My Laptop executes ‚Üí Stores results in S3/Blob/GCS RAG
   ‚Üí Physical Laptop syncs latest state from S3/Blob/GCS
   ```

3. **Scheduled Execution Flow** (Extend My Laptop only):
   ```
   Scheduler (EventBridge/Logic Apps/Cloud Scheduler) triggers at scheduled time
   ‚Üí Extend My Laptop starts (Fargate/Container Instance/Cloud Run)
   ‚Üí Loads RAG from S3/Blob/GCS (estate, chat history, previous executions)
   ‚Üí Sends query + context to AI Server
   ‚Üí AI Server returns execution plan
   ‚Üí Extend My Laptop executes operations ‚Üí Cloud APIs
   ‚Üí Stores results in RAG ‚Üí Uploads RAG to S3/Blob/GCS
   ‚Üí Extend My Laptop shuts down (event-based lifecycle)
   ```

4. **State Synchronization**:
   - **Local Only**: Periodic backup from local RAG to S3/Blob/GCS (hourly, configurable)
   - **Extend My Laptop**: Physical Laptop pulls latest state from S3/Blob/GCS on demand or periodically
   - **Single Source of Truth**: Local RAG (Local Only) or S3/Blob/GCS RAG (Extend My Laptop)

**Multi-Cloud Management**:
- Extend My Laptop (e.g., on AWS) manages **all clouds** (AWS + Azure + GCP)
- User installs credentials for all clouds in Extend My Laptop's credential store
- Example: AWS Fargate Extend My Laptop with AWS credentials (SSM) + Azure Service Principal (SSM) + GCP Service Account (SSM)

**Escher AI Server Role**:
- **100% Stateless**: Stores nothing about users, no credentials, no state
- **Provides**: LLM responses, operation suggestions, playbook generation, AI intelligence
- **Communication**: Physical Laptop ‚Üî AI Server (for conversational AI), Extend My Laptop ‚Üî AI Server (for scheduled job intelligence)

**Pros**:
- 24/7 operations without laptop online
- Scheduled jobs run reliably
- Long-running operations don't block laptop
- Cross-device access to state
- Event-based compute = lower costs than always-on

**Cons**:
- Cloud infrastructure costs (EventBridge, Fargate/Container Instances, S3/Blob/GCS)
- More complex setup
- Cold start delays for event-based execution

---

### **User Choice**

Users can switch between models:
- Start with **Local Only** for simplicity
- Upgrade to **Extend My Laptop** when they need scheduling/automation
- Downgrade back to **Local Only** anytime (Extend My Laptop infrastructure can be destroyed)

---

### **Alert & Event Handling Architecture**

Escher provides **two types of alert systems** to ensure comprehensive monitoring - "Sensors" that act like the nervous system, continuously monitoring the cloud environment and alerting the "Brain" (AI Server) when action is needed.

#### **1. Real-Time Operational Alerts** (üö® Can't Wait - Immediate Action Required)

**Purpose**: Immediate notification and action for critical events that require urgent attention

**Target Events**:
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Production database down, security breach (public S3 with PII), service outage, budget exceeded 200%
- üü† **HIGH**: Performance degradation, significant cost spike, compliance violation, resource failure
- üü° **MEDIUM**: Resource warnings, capacity approaching limits, optimization opportunities
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **INFO**: Informational events (aggregated in morning report)

**Setup Process** (During Extend My Laptop Installation):

1. **Add Escher Listener to Source of Truth**:
   User grants Escher permission to add event listeners to cloud-native alert sources:
   - **AWS**: CloudWatch Alarms ‚Üí EventBridge ‚Üí Extend My Laptop
   - **Azure**: Azure Monitor Alerts ‚Üí Event Grid ‚Üí Extend My Laptop
   - **GCP**: Cloud Monitoring ‚Üí Pub/Sub ‚Üí Extend My Laptop

2. **Pre-Approve Auto-Remediation** (Setup Wizard):
   User chooses which "first aid" actions Escher can perform automatically:
   ```
   ‚òëÔ∏è Automatically make public S3 buckets private
   ‚òëÔ∏è Automatically stop idle instances after 2 hours
   ‚òëÔ∏è Automatically enable encryption on unencrypted volumes
   ‚òëÔ∏è Automatically scale up resources approaching capacity
   ‚òê Automatically restart failed services
   ‚òê Automatically rollback failed deployments
   ```
   - User can modify these settings anytime in application settings
   - Each auto-remediation action logs to immutable audit trail

**Real-Time Alert Flow**:

```
Critical Event Occurs (e.g., S3 bucket made public)
‚Üì
Cloud-Native Alert (CloudWatch/Azure Monitor/GCP Monitoring) detects at source of truth
‚Üì
Event published to EventBridge/Event Grid/Pub Sub
‚Üì
Extend My Laptop wakes up (Fargate/Container Instance/Cloud Run triggered)
‚Üì
Extend My Laptop loads RAG from S3/Blob/GCS:
‚îú‚îÄ Estate: Which S3 bucket? Production or dev? Contains PII?
‚îú‚îÄ Alert Rules: User's configured severity thresholds and customized critical definitions
‚îú‚îÄ Previous Incidents: Similar alerts in past? How resolved?
‚îî‚îÄ Auto-Remediation Settings: Is "make bucket private" pre-approved?
‚Üì
Normalize event to unified schema:
‚îú‚îÄ event_type: "s3_bucket_public"
‚îú‚îÄ severity: Auto-calculated based on estate context (PII detected = CRITICAL)
‚îú‚îÄ resource: { bucket_name, region, account_id, tags }
‚îú‚îÄ context: { environment: "production", data_classification: "PII" }
‚îî‚îÄ timestamp: ISO-8601
‚Üì
Send unified event + context to AI Server (Escher Brain)
‚Üì
AI Server analyzes:
‚îú‚îÄ Severity Assessment: CRITICAL (PII exposed publicly)
‚îú‚îÄ Root Cause: Security group rule changed by user john@company.com at 10:34 AM
‚îú‚îÄ First Aid Recommendation: Make bucket private immediately (aws s3api put-bucket-acl)
‚îú‚îÄ Impact Assessment: ~1.2M customer records exposed, zero downtime to fix
‚îú‚îÄ Playbook: Step-by-step remediation + prevent future occurrences
‚îî‚îÄ Risk: If not fixed within 1 hour, potential GDPR violation
‚Üì
Response sent back to Extend My Laptop
‚Üì
Decision Point - Is auto-remediation pre-approved?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Execute immediately:
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Run: aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket my-data --acl private
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Verify: Bucket now private ‚úÖ
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Store result in RAG (Alerts & Events collection)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Prepare notification: "CRITICAL alert auto-resolved"
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Request approval:
    ‚îú‚îÄ Store alert in RAG
    ‚îî‚îÄ Prepare notification: "CRITICAL alert requires approval"
‚Üì
Notification via cloud-native services:
‚îú‚îÄ üî¥ CRITICAL: AWS SNS/Azure Notification Hubs/GCP Cloud Messaging
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Channels: Email + SMS + Slack/PagerDuty
‚îú‚îÄ üü† HIGH: Email + Slack only
‚îî‚îÄ üü° MEDIUM: In-app notification banner
‚Üì
Store complete alert record in RAG (Alerts & Events collection):
‚îú‚îÄ Event details, AI analysis, action taken, notification sent
‚îú‚îÄ Immutable (cannot be modified after creation)
‚îî‚îÄ Used for queries, comparisons, and compliance reporting
‚Üì
Extend My Laptop shuts down (event-based lifecycle)
```

**Unified Event Schema** (Cross-Cloud Normalization):

All cloud events are normalized to a unified schema before sending to AI Server:

```typescript
interface UnifiedEvent {
  event_id: string;
  event_type: string; // "s3_bucket_public", "vm_stopped", "cost_spike", etc.
  severity: "CRITICAL" | "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "INFO"; // Auto-calculated or user-customized
  cloud_provider: "aws" | "azure" | "gcp";
  account_id: string;
  region: string;
  resource: {
    type: string; // "s3_bucket", "ec2_instance", etc.
    id: string;
    name: string;
    tags: Record<string, string>;
    metadata: Record<string, any>;
  };
  context: {
    environment?: "production" | "staging" | "dev";
    data_classification?: "PII" | "confidential" | "public";
    cost_impact?: number; // USD per day
    affected_users?: number;
  };
  timestamp: string; // ISO-8601
  raw_event: any; // Original cloud-specific event for reference
}
```

**Notification Channels** (Cloud-Native):

- **AWS**: Amazon SNS ‚Üí Email, SMS, Slack (via webhook), PagerDuty (via integration)
- **Azure**: Azure Notification Hubs ‚Üí Email, SMS, Teams, Slack
- **GCP**: Cloud Messaging ‚Üí Email, SMS, Slack, PagerDuty

**Local Only Limitation**:
- Real-time alerts require **Extend My Laptop** for 24/7 monitoring
- OR laptop must remain **always-on** for Local Only mode
- Local Only users with always-on can receive real-time alerts via polling (every 1 minute for CRITICAL, every 5 minutes for HIGH)

---

#### **2. Scheduled Scan Alerts** (‚ÑπÔ∏è Can Wait - Interactive Morning Report)

**Purpose**: Proactive monitoring, optimization suggestions, and aggregated insights delivered daily

**Scan Schedule**: Daily at 2am (same as cost/audit sync), user-configurable

**Scans Performed**:
- üí∞ **Cost Analysis**: Spending trends, budget tracking, anomaly detection, waste identification
- üîí **Security Posture**: Compliance checks (CIS, SOC2, HIPAA), policy violations, encryption status
- ‚ö° **Resource Optimization**: Idle resources, rightsizing opportunities, over-provisioned VMs
- üîß **Operational Health**: Backup status, snapshot age, service availability, performance metrics
- üìä **Performance Monitoring**: Resource utilization, bottlenecks, capacity planning

**Scheduled Scan Flow**:

```

User: "Why did spending increase 17%?"

AI Response:
"Spending increased by $186 (17.5%) yesterday due to three main factors:

1. **3 new EC2 instances in production** (+$144/day = 77% of increase)
   - Instance IDs: i-0a1b2c3, i-4d5e6f7, i-8g9h0i1
   - Type: m5.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 32GB RAM) - $0.384/hour each
   - Launched: Yesterday 10:34 AM by john@company.com
   - Purpose (from tags): "web-tier-scaling" for Black Friday prep
   - Running time: 13.5 hours = $15.60 each = $46.80 total (but daily cost will be $144)

2. **RDS storage auto-scaling** (+$25/day = 13% of increase)
   - Database: prod-db-01 scaled from 100GB ‚Üí 150GB
   - Trigger: 90% capacity threshold reached
   - Root cause: Log retention changed from 7 ‚Üí 30 days (3.2GB logs/day)
   - Cost: $0.115/GB-month = $2.50/day additional

3. **Increased S3 storage** (+$12/day = 6% of increase)
   - New backup policy storing application logs to S3
   - Data ingested: 960GB over last 24 hours
   - Cost: $0.023/GB-month = $12/day

üí° **To reduce costs**:
- If Black Friday prep is complete, stop the 3 EC2 instances (saves $144/day)
- Reduce RDS log retention to 14 days (saves $10/day)
- Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering for logs (saves ~30% = $3.60/day)

**Total potential daily savings: $157.60 ($4,728/month)**

Would you like me to:
1. Check if the EC2 instances are still needed (analyze current load)?
2. Create a playbook to optimize these costs?
3. Schedule automatic shutdown of instances after business hours?"

## Escher AI Server Architecture

### **Stateless Processing Engine**

The Escher AI Server is a **pure stateless processing engine** - it receives requests, processes them using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and returns responses without storing any user data.

### **Server Capabilities**

**Built-in RAG Knowledge Base:**
- **Playbook Library**: Comprehensive library of cloud operation playbooks (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **CLI Command Database**: Complete reference of cloud CLI commands and their usage
- **Best Practices**: Cloud architecture patterns, security guidelines, cost optimization strategies
- **Multi-Cloud Operations**: Cross-cloud equivalents and migration patterns

**AI Processing:**
- Natural language understanding (user intent extraction)
- Context-aware response generation
- Operation planning and sequencing
- Playbook generation and customization
- Anomaly detection and recommendations

### **Data Flow Details**

#### **1. Interactive Query Flow (Physical/Extend My Laptop ‚Üí AI Server)**

```
User: "Show me all running EC2 instances in us-east-1"

Physical/Extend My Laptop (Client-Side Processing):
‚îú‚îÄ Search local RAG (vector store):
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Cloud Estate Inventory: Check for EC2 instances in us-east-1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Chat History: Retrieve previous conversation context
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Executed Operations: Check recent EC2-related operations
‚îî‚îÄ Prepare context from RAG results

Physical/Extend My Laptop ‚Üí Escher AI Server:
‚îú‚îÄ Query: "Show me all running EC2 instances in us-east-1"
‚îî‚îÄ Context from RAG:
    ‚îú‚îÄ Previous chat history (last 5 messages for continuity)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Relevant estate info (EC2 instance count, regions)
    ‚îî‚îÄ Recent operations (any EC2 operations in last hour)

Escher AI Server Processing:
‚îú‚îÄ Parse intent: List resources
‚îú‚îÄ Identify scope: EC2, us-east-1, running state
‚îú‚îÄ RAG lookup: EC2 list commands/APIs
‚îú‚îÄ Analyze context: Understand user's recent activities
‚îî‚îÄ Generate response type: Information query (not execution)

Escher AI Server ‚Üí Physical/Extend My Laptop:
‚îú‚îÄ Response Type: "information" | "execution" | "report"
‚îú‚îÄ Operation: { type: "list_ec2", filters: { region: "us-east-1", state: "running" } }
‚îî‚îÄ Suggested Display: Table format with instance details

Physical/Extend My Laptop:

4. ‚úÖ Export formats (PDF, CSV, Excel, JSON via AI generation)
5. ‚úÖ Daily sync for Manager persona (cost + audit logs at 2am)

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Define Personas & RBAC (PENDING)
1. Complete persona definitions (Manager, Executor, others?)
2. Permission model per persona
3. Approval workflows (local vs cloud-based)
4. "Extend me" pattern implementation details
5. Team collaboration mechanisms

### ‚è≥ Phase 4: Document Complete Operations (PENDING)
1. List all supported cloud operations by category
2. Define which operations need approval
3. Risk levels per operation type
4. Automation boundaries
5. Multi-account/subscription/project patterns

## Alignment Check

### ‚úÖ **Fully Aligned & Documented**
- Multi-cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP) with conversational interface
- Two deployment models (Local Only and Extend My Laptop) based on user needs
- State and execution in user's control (local or user's cloud)
- Escher AI Server 100% stateless (no user data, credentials, or state)
- Extend My Laptop provisioned in user's account with user's credentials
- Scheduled operations via cloud schedulers (EventBridge/Logic Apps/Cloud Scheduler)
- Multi-cloud management from single Extend My Laptop
- Rust execution engine for operations (playbooks, CLI commands, shell scripts)
- **Immutable reports in vector store** (cost, audit logs, compliance)
- **Daily sync for Manager persona** (cost + audit logs + security scans + morning report at 2am)
- **Client-side RAG** with 5 collections (estate, chat, operations, immutable reports, **alerts & events**)
- **Server-side RAG** with playbook library and cloud operations knowledge
- **V2 release plan** for optional central immutable reports
- **Alert & Event Handling**:
  - Real-time operational alerts (Escher listener at source, auto-remediation, cloud-native notifications)
  - Scheduled scan alerts (daily scans, interactive morning report with AI-powered Q&A)
  - Unified event schema for cross-cloud normalization
  - Permanent storage in vector store for historical analysis

### üü° **Partially Defined - Need Details**
- Multi-account/subscription/project credential management
- Collaboration and approval workflows
- "Extend me" pattern implementation

### ‚ùå **Not Yet Documented**
- Complete list of supported cloud operations by category
- Personas & RBAC model details
- Budget management features
- Notification and alerting mechanisms (email delivery, Slack, PagerDuty)
