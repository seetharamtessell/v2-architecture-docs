# Documentation Gap Analysis Report
## Generated: October 14, 2025

**Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED**

This report identifies inconsistencies and gaps across the v2 architecture documentation that must be resolved to ensure the documentation is solid and complete.

---

## üìã **Executive Summary**

### **Critical Findings:**

1. **üî¥ CRITICAL**: RAG Collections mismatch - PRODUCT-VISION defines 5 collections, storage-service implements 2
2. **üü† HIGH**: Old terminology still present throughout many documents
3. **üü† HIGH**: Overview files (architecture.md, system-overview.md) reference outdated "AWS CloudOps AI Agent"
4. **üü° MEDIUM**: Multi-cloud support inconsistently documented (AWS-only vs AWS/Azure/GCP)
5. **üü° MEDIUM**: "Extend My Laptop" technical term used inconsistently

---

## üî¥ **Critical Gaps (Must Fix)**

### **1. RAG Collections Architecture Mismatch**

**Impact**: Foundation architecture is inconsistent

**PRODUCT-VISION.md says**:
```
CLIENT-SIDE RAG (5 COLLECTIONS)
1. Cloud Estate Inventory
2. Chat History
3. Executed Operations
4. Immutable Reports
5. Alerts & Events
```

**storage-service/collections.md says**:
```
Two Qdrant collections:
1. chat_history
2. aws_estate
```

**Problem**:
- Where are "Executed Operations", "Immutable Reports", and "Alerts & Events" stored?
- Are they separate collections or part of existing ones?
- UI mock contracts reference these collections, but storage service doesn't implement them

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Decide: Should storage-service implement all 5 collections?
- [ ] OR: Update PRODUCT-VISION to reflect 2-collection architecture
- [ ] OR: Document that 3 additional collections will be implemented in Phase 2
- [ ] Update UI mock contracts to match actual storage architecture

**Files Affected**:
- `/docs/02-client/modules/storage-service/collections.md`
- `/docs/01-overview/PRODUCT-VISION.md` (lines 960-982)
- `/docs/02-client/ui-team-implementation/04-mock-contracts.md`

---

### **2. Overview Documentation Outdated**

**Impact**: First-time readers get wrong information about the product

**Files with Issues**:

#### **`/docs/01-overview/architecture.md`**
- Line 0: Still says "AWS CloudOps AI Agent" (not "Escher")
- AWS-only focus (no multi-cloud)
- No mention of "Run on Laptop" vs "Extend to Cloud" options
- Doesn't reflect stateless server architecture

#### **`/docs/01-overview/system-overview.md`**
- Line 3: Still says "AWS CloudOps AI Agent"
- Doesn't mention multi-cloud support
- References old architecture.md

#### **`/docs/01-overview/key-decisions.md`**
- AWS-focused (no mention of Azure/GCP)
- No mention of deployment options
- Missing alert system, cost management decisions

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Rewrite `/docs/01-overview/architecture.md` to match PRODUCT-VISION
- [ ] Update `/docs/01-overview/system-overview.md` with correct product name
- [ ] Update `/docs/01-overview/key-decisions.md` with new architectural decisions

---

## üü† **High Priority Gaps**

### **3. Terminology Inconsistency Across Documents**

**PRODUCT-VISION.md uses**: "Run on Your Laptop" / "Extend to Your Cloud"

**Other docs still use**:
- "Local Only" - found in UI implementation docs
- "Extend My Laptop" - found throughout as technical component name
- "deployment model" - found in UI implementation plan

**Where Found**:
```
./02-client/ui-team-implementation/02-implementation-plan.md:
- "deployment model switching"
- "Settings (NEW - deployment model, auto-remediation)"
- "Deployment Setup Wizard (NEW - 'Extend My Laptop' configuration)"

./02-client/ui-team-implementation/01-architecture.md:
- "DeploymentSetupWizard.tsx - Guide for 'Extend My Laptop' setup"

./02-client/ui-team-implementation/04-mock-contracts.md:
- "console.log('[Mock] Updated deployment model:', params.model);"
```

**Clarification Needed**:
- Is "Extend My Laptop" acceptable as a **technical component name** (in code)?
- Or should it be renamed to "CloudExtension" / "ExtendedRuntime"?

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Define: User-facing terms vs technical/code terms
- [ ] Update UI implementation docs with correct terminology
- [ ] Create terminology glossary for developers

---

### **4. Multi-Cloud Support Documentation Inconsistency**

**PRODUCT-VISION.md**: Multi-cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP) - prominently featured

**Other docs**:
- `architecture.md`: AWS-only
- `system-overview.md`: "AWS CloudOps AI Agent"
- `storage-service/collections.md`: "AWS Estate" collection (line 10)
- Many Tauri commands: "aws_estate" naming (AWS-specific)

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Update storage service to use "cloud_estate" (not "aws_estate")
- [ ] Update Tauri command names to be cloud-agnostic
- [ ] Update all overview docs to emphasize multi-cloud
- [ ] OR: Document AWS-first approach with Azure/GCP as Phase 2

---

## üü° **Medium Priority Gaps**

### **5. "Extend My Laptop" Technical Term Usage**

**In PRODUCT-VISION.md**:
- Used as both user-facing option name AND technical component name
- Example (line 164): "Extend My Laptop (User's Cloud)" in architecture diagram
- Example (line 193): "| **Extend My Laptop** | Scheduled ops..." in table
- Example (line 305): "Extend My Laptop wakes up (Fargate/Container Instance)"

**Question**: Is this intentional?
- User-facing: "Extend to Your Cloud"
- Technical/Architecture: "Extend My Laptop" component

**If intentional**: Document this clearly in terminology guide
**If not intentional**: Need to update all technical diagrams

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Clarify terminology strategy (user-facing vs technical)
- [ ] Update PRODUCT-VISION diagrams if needed
- [ ] Document in style guide

---

### **6. Alert System Implementation Details**

**PRODUCT-VISION.md**: Comprehensive alert system with 2 types (real-time + scheduled)

**Missing Details**:
- How are alerts stored in "Alerts & Events" collection?
- Schema for alert objects?
- Storage service doesn't have alerts collection
- No Tauri commands for alert management

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Document alert storage schema
- [ ] Add alerts collection to storage service docs
- [ ] Add alert Tauri commands to integration docs

---

### **7. Cost Management Data Storage**

**PRODUCT-VISION.md**: Immutable Reports collection stores cost data

**Missing Details**:
- Cost report schema not documented
- How are daily snapshots stored?
- Query patterns for cost analysis?
- Storage service doesn't mention cost reports

**Required Action**:
- [ ] Document cost report schema
- [ ] Add to immutable reports collection docs
- [ ] Add cost management Tauri commands

---

3. **Multi-Cloud Terminology** (Foundation issue)
   - Decide: AWS-first or truly multi-cloud?
   - Update collection names (aws_estate ‚Üí cloud_estate?)
   - Update all references

### **Phase 2: High Priority (Do Next)**

4. **Terminology Consistency**
   - Create terminology glossary
   - User-facing vs technical terms
   - Update UI implementation docs
